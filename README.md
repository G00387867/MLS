- #### _The Chi-squared test for independence:_

Investigation into some data using the Chi-squared test for independence to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent.

- #### _The Standard Deviation:_

Explaining the difference between `STDEV.P` and `STDEV.S` and using ` numpy` to perform a simulation demonstrating that the `STDEV.S` calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. 

- ####  _k Nearest Neighbours "kNN" on Fisher’s Iris Data Set:_

Using `Scikit-Learn` to apply _k_ Nearest Neighbours clustering to Fisher’s famous Iris data set.
